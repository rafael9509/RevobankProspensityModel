 ### [Final Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1I_JkaywhbJEXcixNsVLkmhLQ3gttIWs_L0r6Kb6Ca5A/edit?usp=sharing)

<h2>Description</h2>
This project focuses on developing a propensity model to predict customer adoption of Revo Bankâ€™s new PayLater feature. Revo Bank, a European financial institution offering products such as checking accounts, savings accounts, money market accounts, certificates of deposit, debit cards, and credit cards, aims to enhance credit card usage through this innovative offering that allows customers to convert e-commerce transactions into fixed installments at a low-interest rate.The analysis begins with data cleaning and preparation, followed by Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify key customer behaviors and preferences. Using historical customer data, the propensity model was developed, achieving an accuracy of 76% in predicting which customers are likely to adopt the PayLater feature.
